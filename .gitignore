# Ignore any .tfvars files that are generated automatically for each Terraform run. Most
# .tfvars files are managed as part of configuration and so should be included in
# version control.

# example.tfvars

# Ignore override files as they are usually used to override resources locally and so
# are not checked in
override.tf

*_override.tf
*_override.tf.json

# Include override files you do wish to add to version control using negated pattern
#
# !example_override.tf

# Include tfplan files to ignore the plan output of command: terraform plan -out=tfplan
# example: *tfplan*

# Always ignore Idea files and directories
