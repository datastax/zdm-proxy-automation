## *****
## This is an example Ansible inventory file that can be used as a guideline when manually creating the Ansible inventory file for a certain ZDM deployment.
##
## IMPORTANT NOTE: Manually creating this file is ONLY needed if the infrastructure was NOT provisioned using the ZDM Terraform automation in this project.
## This is because the ZDM Terraform automation creates the Ansible inventory file automatically and places it in the correct location - in which case no manual operation is needed.
##
## Please remove this comment from the manually created file.
