## *****
## This is an example inventory file that can be used as a guideline when manually creating the inventory file for a certain deployment.
##
## IMPORTANT NOTE: Manually creating this file is ONLY needed if the infrastructure was NOT provisioned using the Cloudgate Terraform automation in this project.
## This is because the Cloudgate Terraform automation creates the inventory file automatically and places it in the correct location - in which case no manual operation is needed.
##
## Please remove this comment from the manually created file.
