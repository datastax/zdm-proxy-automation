## *****
## This is an example custom SSH config file that can be used as a guideline when manually creating the custom SSH config file for a certain ZDM deployment.
##
## IMPORTANT NOTE: Manually creating this file is ONLY needed if the infrastructure was NOT provisioned using the ZDM Terraform automation in this project.
## This is because the ZDM Terraform automation creates the custom SSH config file automatically and places it in the correct location - in which case no manual operation is needed.
##
## Please remove this comment from the manually created file.
